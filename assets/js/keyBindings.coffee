Terminology:
      key       - a key corresponds to a keypress, including modifiers/special keys
      command   - a command is a semantic event (see keyDefinitions.coffee)
      mode      - same as vim's notion of modes.  each mode determines the set of possible commands, and a new set of bindings
      mode type - there are two mode types: insert-like and normal-like.  Each mode falls into precisely one of these two categories.
                  'insert-like' describes modes in which typing characters inserts the characters.
                  Thus the only keys configurable as commands are those with modifiers.
                  'normal-like' describes modes in which the user is not typing, and all keys are potential commands.

The Keybindings class is primarily responsible for dealing with hotkeys
Given a hotkey mapping, it combines it with key definitions to create a bindings dictionary,
also performing some validation on the hotkeys.
Concretely, it exposes 2 main objects:
      hotkeys:
          a 2-layered mapping.  For each mode type and command name, contains a list of keys
          this is the object the user can configure
      bindings:
          another 2-layer mapping.  For each mode and relevant key, maps to the corresponding command's function
          this is the object used internally for handling keys (i.e. translating them to commands)
It also internally maintains
      keyMaps:
          a 2-layer mapping similar to hotkeys.  For each mode and command name, a list of keys.
          Used for rendering the hotkeys table
          besides translating the mode types into each mode, keyMaps differs from hotkeys by handles some quirky behavior,
          such as making the DELETE_CHAR command always act like DELETE in visual/visual_line modes
